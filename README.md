# COVID19-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
## Overview

This project analyzes the spread of COVID-19 and its correlation with factors from the World Happiness Report. Tasks include data cleaning, visualization, and deriving insights using Python.

# Key Tasks

## Task 1: Importing Modules

  • Libraries used: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## Task 2: COVID-19 Dataset Analysis

  • Imported Covid19_Confirmed_dataset.csv and checked its shape.

  • Dropped irrelevant columns and aggregated rows by country.

  • Visualized data trends for specific countries (e.g., China).

## Task 3: Calculating a Good Measure

  • Computed the first derivative of the infection curve.

  • Found maximum infection rates for individual countries.

  • Created a new DataFrame with relevant columns (country and max infection rate).

## Task 4: World Happiness Report Analysis

  • Imported and cleaned WorldHappinessReport.csv.

  • Adjusted indices and merged it with the COVID-19 dataset.

  • Created a correlation matrix to analyze relationships between happiness factors (e.g., GDP, social support) and infection rates.

## Task 5: Visualization of Results

  Plotted relationships between maximum infection rates and factors like:

  • GDP

  • Social support

  • Healthy life expectancy

  • Freedom to make life choices

## Key Learnings

  • Cleaning and preprocessing data for analysis.
## Conclusion

  This project explores the relationship between pandemic data and happiness metrics, demonstrating end-to-end data analysis from cleaning to visualization.

  • Visualizing data trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

  • Calculating derivatives and creating correlation matrices.

  • Merging datasets and deriving meaningful insights.
